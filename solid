      - break the intrface down into smaller pieces that clients can agree on that, make the interface more modular.
      
      
[LSP] Liskov Substitution Principle :

[DRY] Dont Repeat Yourself : never write anythink twice

[DIP] Dependency Inversion Principle : high level modules should not depend on low leve modules but bow should depend on abstarcions 
                                       and those abstractions should not depend on deteails
