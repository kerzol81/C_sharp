[ISP] Interface Segregation Principle : a client should not be forced to depent on interfaces they don't use.
      - break the intrface down into smaller pieces that clients can agree on that, make the interface more modular.
      
      
[LSP] Liskov Substitution Principle :

[DRY] Dont Repeat Yourself : never write anythink twice

[DIP] Dependency Inversion Principle : high level modules should not depend on low leve modules but bow should depend on abstarcions 
                                       and those abstractions should not depend on deteails
      - resolve this with Interface, 
      "those abstractions" shouldn't have to know about how things get done, they should just say that these ar the things will get done
